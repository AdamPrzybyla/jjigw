1. Requirements:

	- Python
	- PyXMPP - http://pyxmpp.jabberstudio.org/

  For latest CVS version of JJIGW you will probably need the latest CVS version of PyXMPP.

2. Configuration:

  - copy jjigw.xml.example to jjigw.xml and edit the latter according to your needs
  - configure your jabber server for connection from the gateway. Jabberd2 does not
    need any extra configuration (just jjigw.xml must much jabberd2 router
    configuration), Jabberd 1.4.x requires, at least, <service> section with
    host/port/secret matching those in jjigw.xml.

3. Running:

  - make sure PyXMPP is installed in your system and Python interpreter can find it
    or link "pyxmpp" from build/lib* directory in PyXMPP sources to jjigw directory
  - start jjigw.py

4. Usage:

  - use your favorite Jabber client to join a room named like an IRC channel
    in the configured network
