- more MUC support - topic change, kick, ban, invite
- multiple domain/network support (easy with Jabberd2 component protocol,
  which is not yet supported by PyXMPP, but with jabber:component:accept could
  also be done).
- channel list browsing (using Service Discovery)
- more IRC stream error handling
- remove unneeded debuging code
